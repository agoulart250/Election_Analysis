# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit:
 The purpose of this project is to create a python code to assist Seth and Tom in performing an election audit for selected counties in the state of Colorado and providing the results of their audit to the election commission.

  Diana DeGette won the election with 272,892 votes, a 73.8% of the total votes for the congressional election.


 ## Election-Audit Summary: 
   - This script can be enhanced to be used for any election by creating an "string input" selection on the code so the user can select the type of election region it relates to (i.e. city, state) and creating a reference to this input for the output portion of the code.
   - Another modification that can be made is to add another column in the data set (i.e. candidate political party) and create an additional section on the code to list the total votes per political party.
